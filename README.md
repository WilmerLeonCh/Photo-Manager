# Photo-Manager
CLI photo manager | challenge EDteam

## Description
EDteam needs to query the Photo API information found in: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

We need a **console application** made in Go that allows us to manage the information from said API. Therefore, when the application starts, a menu will appear where the action to be performed will be selected (create, consult, list, modify, delete).

It's very important to us to know when a person creates or deletes a photo, so we need **Slack to be notified when those actions happen**. We leave the format of the notification to your imagination.
